## Git Workflow

### Creating a Pull Request

- Branch new features off the `develop` branch.
- Naming convention based off the git issue number in Zenhub.  (i.e. Feature-78, Bug-44, Documentation-54, Order-66 )
- Before pushing your new feature up to prod make sure to pull in the latest develop and fix any merge conflicts that might happen.
`git pull origin develop`
- Push your branch up to github.
`git push origin <branchname>`
- open a pull request against develop and request a team member review it.


### Merging your code into develop.

- Github will not let you merge code that has not passed the following checks
  - The pipeline builds correctly (all unit tests pass)

  - Another developer has performed code review and you have implemented requested changes

  - Your branch is not behind develop in terms of commits.  If it is, pull the changes into your branch and resolve any merge conflicts.
- Once these conditions are met Github will allow you to merge in your code.
- After merge is complete besure to delete the feature branch so that it doesn't clutter the github site.

### Deploying to test and prod

- When we wish to deploy to test and prod, make a PR from develop -> master.
- Master will be updated on a regular basis by the repos admin.
